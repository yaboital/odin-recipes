        <h5>Serves: 4-6 | Prep Time: 15 Minutes | Cook Time: 8 minutes</h5>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp dijon mustard</li>
            <li>3 garlic cloves, minced</li>
            <li>½ tbsp apple cider vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tbsp tamarind paste</li>
            <li>250ml grapeseed oil</li>
            <li>80g white miso paste</li>
            <li>1 green chilli, de-seeded and finly chopped</li>
            <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
            <li>4 corn cobs, husks removed and cut into 5cm segments</li>
            <li>2 tbsp finely chopped parsley</li>
            <li>Flaked kosher salt and blake pepper</li>
        </ul>  
        <h4>Method</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>First make the mayonnaise. Place the yolk, mustard, garlic, vinegar and tamarind in the small bowl of a food processor. Turn it on and slowly start adding the grapseed oil, continually pouring in a light stream until half the oil is incorporated.</li>
            <li>With the machine still running, add the miso and continue with the last of the oil until the mayonnaise is thick. Add the chilli and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pan of water to the boil. Add the corn and blanch for three minutes. Drain, pat dry and mix with the olive oil and ¼ tsp salt. Place a chargrill pan on a very high heat. When it starts to smoke, add the corn and chargrill, turning often so that all sides get coloured, for about eight minutes.</li>
            <li>As soon as the corn comes off the chargrill, brush a layer of the mayonnaise all over it, so that it gets a light glaze – about 2 tbsp for all the corn.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle with parsley and eat straight away, dipping the corn in the remaining mayonnaise as you go, or spreading on more with a knife.</li>
        </ol>
